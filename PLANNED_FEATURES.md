# Planned features

Features that would greatly increase the usefulness of this project

- [ ] provide a docker container to run an MCP based agent (like the claude computer use demo here https://github.com/anthropics/anthropic-quickstarts/tree/main/computer-use-demo)
  - [ ] this should make it easier for the agent to execute the mouse action(s)
- [ ] hosting screenshots on a blossom server
- [ ] have the agent post a kind 1 note linking to the job to advertise it among social media and increase the odds of a human being notified more quickly
- [ ] switch from using webln to bitconnect in the frontend gui so we can check when the user's invoice gets paid and show a notification
