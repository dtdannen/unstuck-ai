# Goose MCP Debug Log

## Current Problem
Goose is unable to take screenshots. When asked to take a screenshot, it says it doesn't have the capability, even though the developer extension's `screen_capture` tool should provide this functionality. Additionally, the Unstuck MCP server is not showing up in the available tools list.

## What We've Tried

### 1. Initial Issue: No Screenshot Capability
- **Problem**: Goose couldn't take screenshots when requested
- **Initial Setup**: Using `--with-extension` flag to load only the unstuck MCP
- **Result**: Only unstuck tools were available, no screenshot capability

### 2. Attempted to Add goose-mcp-server Package
- **Action**: Added `goose-mcp-server` to requirements.txt
- **Result**: Build failed - package doesn't exist on PyPI
- **Learning**: Computer Controller is a built-in extension, not a separate package

### 3. Configured Built-in Extensions
- **Actions Taken**:
  - Removed non-existent `goose-mcp-server` from requirements.txt
  - Removed invalid `goose-computer` entry from mcp_servers.json
  - Updated config.yaml to enable computercontroller and developer extensions
  - Updated profiles.yaml to use Anthropic instead of OpenAI
- **Result**: Configuration files properly set up

### 4. Changed Startup Command to Use Built-in Extensions
- **Action**: Changed from `goose session --with-extension "fastmcp..."` to `goose session --with-builtin "developer,computercontroller"`
- **Result**: Built-in extensions loaded successfully (developer tools including screen_capture appeared)
- **New Problem**: Unstuck MCP server no longer available

### 5. Attempted to Combine Profile and Built-in Flags
- **Action**: Used `goose session --profile default --with-builtin "developer,computercontroller"`
- **Result**: Error - "unexpected argument '--profile' found"
- **Learning**: Cannot combine --profile and --with-builtin flags

## Current Status
- Built-in extensions work when using `--with-builtin` flag
- MCP servers (unstuck) don't load when using `--with-builtin` 
- Cannot combine `--profile` and `--with-builtin` flags
- Need a way to load both built-in extensions AND MCP servers

### 6. Attempted to Use Profile Flag Alone
- **Action**: Used `goose session --profile default`
- **Result**: Error - "unexpected argument '--profile' found"
- **Issue**: The --profile flag doesn't seem to be recognized by this version of Goose

## Next Steps to Try
1. Use no flags and rely on default config loading
2. Use `--with-builtin` for built-in extensions and `--with-extension` for MCP servers in the same command
3. Check the exact Goose version and its supported flags
4. Try using environment variables to configure the provider/model instead of profiles
