# Unstuck MCP Server + Goose Docker Integration Progress

## Session Summary
We worked on integrating the unstuck MCP server into a sandboxed Goose Docker environment. The goal was to make the unstuck MCP server available as a tool within Goose running in Docker, matching the successful local setup described in README.md.

## What We Know Works ‚úÖ

### Local Setup (Confirmed Working)
From README.md and GOOSE_SETUP.md, the local setup that works is:
1. Start MCP server: `fastmcp run unstuck_ai/server.py:mcp --transport sse`
2. Start Goose: `goose session --with-remote-extension http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse`

### Docker Environment Components ‚úÖ
1. **VNC Server**: Successfully running on port 5901 with noVNC on 6080
2. **X11 Display**: Working properly (`:1`) for GUI applications
3. **Unstuck MCP Server**: Can import and initialize successfully after VNC starts
4. **FastMCP**: Successfully starts unstuck server on http://127.0.0.1:8000
5. **PyAutoGUI**: Works for screenshots, mouse movement, and clicking
6. **Environment Variables**: All unstuck server dependencies properly set

### Current Status ‚úÖ
- Docker container builds and starts successfully
- VNC/noVNC desktop environment working
- Unstuck MCP server starts and runs on port 8000 via FastMCP
- All automation tools (screenshots, mouse control) functional
- Goose API server runs on port 8888

## What Didn't Work ‚ùå

### Goose Extension Configuration Approaches Tried
1. **MCP Servers JSON**: Added unstuck to mcp_servers.json - Goose didn't load it
2. **Stdio Extensions in config.yaml**: Profile validation errors
3. **Toolkits in profiles.yaml**: Computer toolkit requirement failures
4. **Mixed profiles.yaml + config.yaml**: Profile format incompatibilities

### Specific Errors Encountered
1. `TypeError: Profile.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'model'`
2. `ValueError: Toolkit computer requires True but it is not present`
3. `TypeError: Profile.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'extensions'`
4. `Error: No such option: --with-remote-extension` (final issue)

## Key Discovery üîç

The critical issue we discovered at the end: **Goose doesn't have the `--with-remote-extension` flag** in the Docker version. This suggests either:
1. Different version of Goose installed in Docker vs local
2. Missing dependencies for remote extension support
3. Need to use different command syntax

## Technical Details

### Docker Setup
- **Base**: Ubuntu 22.04
- **Goose Installation**: `pip3 install goose-ai`
- **FastMCP**: Installed via unstuck server requirements
- **Environment**: All required env vars for unstuck server set

### File Structure Created
```
agents/goose-docker/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goose_config.yaml (profiles.yaml format)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml (basic goose config)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_servers.json (unused)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ scripts/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ goose_api.py (modified for remote extension)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mcp_wrapper.py (unused)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile (updated for unstuck server)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ docker-compose.yml (env vars added)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ entrypoint.sh (starts fastmcp + goose)
```

### Startup Sequence
1. VNC server starts
2. Unstuck MCP server starts via FastMCP on port 8000
3. Goose API server starts on port 8888
4. Goose attempts to start with remote extension (fails)

## Next Steps üéØ

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Investigate Goose version**: Check what version is installed and if it supports remote extensions
2. **Check Goose help**: Run `goose session --help` to see available options
3. **Try alternative approaches**:
   - Different remote extension syntax
   - Install different Goose version with remote extension support
   - Use MCP client libraries directly

### Investigation Commands
```bash
# Check Goose version and capabilities
goose --version
goose session --help
pip show goose-ai

# Test FastMCP server directly
curl http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse
```

### Alternative Approaches to Try
1. **Direct MCP Client**: Create a bridge that connects Goose to FastMCP server
2. **Stdio Wrapper**: Create a wrapper script that Goose can load as stdio extension
3. **Different Goose Version**: Try newer/different version with remote extension support
4. **Manual Integration**: Modify Goose source to add MCP client support

### Files to Focus On
- `agents/goose-docker/scripts/goose_api.py` - Goose startup command
- `agents/goose-docker/entrypoint.sh` - Service startup sequence
- `agents/goose-docker/requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Environment Context

### Working Local Command (Reference)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start MCP server
cd mcp_server/
fastmcp run unstuck_ai/server.py:mcp --transport sse

# Terminal 2: Start Goose with remote extension
goose session --with-remote-extension http://127.0.0.1:8000/sse
```

### Current Docker Status
- ‚úÖ FastMCP server: Running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
- ‚úÖ Goose API: Running on http://localhost:8888
- ‚úÖ VNC Desktop: http://localhost:6080
- ‚ùå Goose + Unstuck integration: Failing due to missing `--with-remote-extension` flag

## Key Insights

1. **Timing**: X11 display must be available before importing unstuck server (PyAutoGUI dependency)
2. **Architecture**: FastMCP + remote extension approach is cleaner than stdio extensions
3. **Local vs Docker**: There's a difference in Goose capabilities between local and Docker installs
4. **Success Pattern**: The local setup works perfectly, so we need to replicate it exactly

## Files Modified in This Session

### Major Changes
- `agents/goose-docker/Dockerfile`: Added unstuck server installation and config copying
- `agents/goose-docker/docker-compose.yml`: Added environment variables for unstuck server
- `agents/goose-docker/entrypoint.sh`: Added FastMCP server startup
- `agents/goose-docker/scripts/goose_api.py`: Modified to use remote extension approach

### Configuration Files
- `agents/goose-docker/config/goose_config.yaml`: Simplified profiles.yaml format
- `agents/goose-docker/config/config.yaml`: Basic Goose configuration
- `agents/goose-docker/config/mcp_servers.json`: Updated but unused in final approach

## Success Criteria

When working properly, we should see:
1. Goose starts without errors
2. `list available tools` shows unstuck/visual help tools
3. Can ask Goose to "take a screenshot and use unstuck tool to get help from humans"
4. Screenshot uploads to Digital Ocean Spaces
5. Nostr events broadcast requesting help
6. Human responses processed and returned to Goose

The foundation is solid - we just need to solve the Goose remote extension flag issue to complete the integration.
